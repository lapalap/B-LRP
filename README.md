## Requirements

To be able to run the code properly, please download the imagenet subset data by following link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hbo7udo721igpnd/imagenet_data.zip?dl=0 and copy the 'imagenet_data' folder to a directory with notebooks

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All experiments were conducted with Python 3.6.9.

## Code structure:

The code is structured in the following way:

  * B-LRP MNIST
    This notebook consists of the code for visualization of B-LRP method for MNIST

  * B-LRP Imagenet
    This notebook consists of the code for visualization of B-LRP method for Imagenet
